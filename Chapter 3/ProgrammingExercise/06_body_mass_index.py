# Write a program that calculates and displays a person’s body mass index (BMI).
# The BMI is often used to determine whether a person is overweight or
# underweight for his or her height. A person’s BMI is calculated with the
# following formula:
#                      BMI = weight * 703 / height^2
# where weight is measured in pounds and height is measured in inches.

# It's pretty broken, especially when used alone.
