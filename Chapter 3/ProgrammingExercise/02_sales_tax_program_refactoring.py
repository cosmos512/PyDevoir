# Programming Exercise #6 in Chapter 2 was the Sales Tax program. For that
# exercise you were asked to write a program that calculates and displays
# the county and state sales tax on a purchase. If you have already written
# that program, redesign it so the subtasks are in functions. If you have
# not already written that program, write it using functions.
