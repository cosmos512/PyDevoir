# There are three seating categories at a stadium. For a softball game, Class A
# seats cost $15, Class B seats cost $12, and Class C seats cost $9. Write a
# program that asks how many tick-ets for each class of seats were sold, and
# then displays the amount of income generated from ticket sales.
