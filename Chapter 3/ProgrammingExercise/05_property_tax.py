# A county collects property taxes on the assessment value of property,
# which is 60 per-cent of the property’s actual value. For example, if
# an acre of land is valued at $10,000, its assessment value is $6,000.
# The property tax is then 64¢ for each $100 of the assess-ment value.
# The tax for the acre assessed at $6,000 will be $38.40. Write a program
# that asks for the actual value of a piece of property and displays the
# assessment value and property tax.



# Hurray for regressive taxes.
