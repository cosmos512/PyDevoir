# Create two variables: top_speed and distance.
top_speed = 160
distance = 300

# Display the values referenced by the variables.
print('The top speed is')
print(top_speed)
print('The distance traveled is')
print(distance)

# Note:
# Don't use a variable before assigning a value for it, don't misspell it,
# and don't use inconsistent case.

# Some other variable rules: can't use Python's 'keywords', no spaces,
# first letter has to be a-z, A-Z, or underscore. Numbers can only be used
# past the first character. Case matters. Pick good, meaningful, names.

# Questions:
# Do you need the spaces around the assignment operator and before the
# octothorpe in comments? (I tried and it was fine, it's probably for
# legibility. Better to check, though.)
