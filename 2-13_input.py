# Get the user's name, age, and income.
name = input('What is your name? ')

income = float(input('What is your income? '))

# Display the data.

# Nosy program.

# Question: So if you enter a integer for the name, or a string for the numbers,
# it obviously doesn't work. There will be a way to not stop the whole program
# if someone's inatentive, right?
